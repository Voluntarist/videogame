Dodge the eyes of Big Brother
=========

This is my first attempt at coding a video game. It's done in Ruby using the Gosu framework.

Make sure to have these gems installed if you attempt to try the game out.
require 'rubygems'
require 'gosu'


Move the hero around with the 4 arrow keys and attempt to dodge the descending eyes of the Thought Police.
Inspired by the novel 1984.
